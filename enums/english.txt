LOCALSET N163_MULTIPLEX       "Multiplex" "The N163 channels are mixed with a 'time share' multiplexing, with a rate dependent on how many channels are active. For 8-channel N163 tunes this produces very unpleasant high frequency hiss. This multiplex sound is accurate, but it disabled by default because it is unpleasant. On RF connected Famicoms, the hiss was reduced a bit from the stronger lowpass filter applied by the RF process."
LOCALSET N163_PHASE_PROTECT   "Phase Protect" "Early emulation assumed that the N163 phase registers did nothing. Some early N163 homebrew writes values to it, causing buzzing or disabling the channels. Disable this to accomodate those homebrew songs."
LOCALSET N163_SHORT_WAVE      "Short Waveform" "Early emulation incorrectly assumed the upper 3 bits of waveform length had no effect, allowing only shorter waveforms. See: Rolling Thunder, its bass tones will sound at the wrong octave with the incorrectly shortened wave."
