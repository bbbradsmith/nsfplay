# NSFPlay 3

This is a work in progress total rewrite of NSFPlay. Goals include:

* Clean separation of sound emulation as a library that can be reused in other projects.
* Cross platform command line player.
* Cross platform GUI player.
* Winamp plugin.
* Rewrite to change the emulation architecture, hopefully more efficient and easier to maintain.
